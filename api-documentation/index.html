<p>Create a request by POSTing to <code class="prettyprint">/requests/</code>.  Use the code samples or the interactive documentation for the <code class="prettyprint">POST /requests</code> resource.</p>

<p>The response includes an <code class="prettyprint">id</code> and an <code class="prettyprint">access_token</code>.  Save these and use them to retrieve the PA later.</p>

<h3 id="retrieving-a-pa">Retrieving a PA</h3>

<p>You can GET a PA using the <code class="prettyprint">GET /requests/</code> resource.</p>

<p>Or, you can diplay the PA in the CoverMyMeds system by constructing a <a href="(http://www.covermymeds.com/request/:id?access_token_id=ttookkeenn)">URL like this</a>: <code class="prettyprint">http://www.covermymeds.com/request/:id?access_token_id=ttookkeenn</code>.</p>

<h3 id="showing-a-task-list">Showing a task list</h3>

<p>You can retrieve a json list of prior authorizations by sending multiple <code class="prettyprint">id</code>s and <code class="prettyprint">access_token</code>s.  You will format this data into a task list in your application. Use the code samples or the interactive documentation for the <code class="prettyprint">GET /requests/</code> resource.</p>

<p><aside class="success">
Make sure to check out our <a href="https://github.com/covermymeds/api-jquery-plugins">javascript components</a> that implement a full-featured API client that you may use in your web, mobile, or desktop app (in a browser-control).  These are used in a <a href="http://covermymeds.github.io/ehr-example/">toy EHR application</a> so you can see how they work.  One significant advantage of this approach is that the task-list included in this library has built in pagination, filtering and search-which you could of course implement on your own but it would take a bit of work.
</aside></p>

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>This API allows companies offering Electronic Health Record (EHR), stand-alone e-prescribing, or Practice Management Systems (&ldquo;Client Systems&rdquo;) to offer a very compelling prior authorization solution to their customers. Integrating with the API should be straightforward for both “on-premise” client server applications and browser-based systems. The API uses vanilla web services (REST), and is backed by development libraries that make using it a piece of cake.</p>

<p>Because PA will eventually become a named HIPAA standard, most EHR systems will need to support an electronic PA solution.  A few may choose to build this themselves from the raw NCPDP ePA transactions, however this involves an incredible amount of work-our experience over the past five years shows that making ePA worth using in the real world is a monumental task that many will wish to avoid.  So that EHR systems can focus on other things, CoverMyMeds&#39; API offers a number of powerful features that you won&rsquo;t get on your own. After completing this integration, your ePA system will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support the <a href="http://www.ncpdp.org/News-Article.aspx?pg=467">NCPDP ePA standard</a></li>
<li>Work for all plans, not just those that support ePA</li>
<li>Turn PA faxes and phone calls from more than 80% of US pharmacies into a task-list in your system</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

<p>Prior Authorization may be initiated “prospectively” in the doctor’s office, or “reactively” after a claim rejection in the pharmacy. The pharmacy industry generally favors moving toward the prospective use case, ideally at the point of prescribing. However, because the majority of PAs are initiated reactively today, we believe it is important to address both use cases. CoverMyMeds’ Prescriber API allows a clinical system vendor&rsquo;s product (Client System) to easily support a paperless process for both workflows.</p>

<p><img src="images/cmm-api-diagram.jpg"></p>

<p><em>The core workflow concept in the CoverMyMeds API is a “PA Task List” that is populated by both reactive pharmacy (rejected claim) transactions and prospective physician (e-prescribing) transactions.</em></p>

<h2 id="integration-components">Integration Components</h2>

<p>You will be supporting three user-interface componenents in your EHR:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A checkbox next to each prescription in your e-prescribing &ldquo;shopping cart.&rdquo;  This allows the prescriber to start a prior authorization when writing a new prescription.  Optionally, you should also consider adding a &ldquo;Start PA&rdquo; button next to each existing prescription.</p></li>
<li><p>A &ldquo;New PA&rdquo; form that allows users to start a prior authorization when one was not started durring the e-prescribing process.</p></li>
<li><p>A Task List which displays the PAs that were started from the e-prescribing or New PA form, in addition to the PAs that were started in the pharmacy after your prescriber sent a prescription (most pharmacies are also integrated with CoverMyMeds). The actual requests are worked and managed on a &ldquo;themed&rdquo; page served by CoverMyMeds after clicking through the Task List.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You will be supporting a few server-side components:</p>

<p>Webserver: You will run a webserver that allows us to POST changes to each existing PA, and to send new PAs that are initiated in integrated pharmacies.</p>

<p>Token Management: You will store <code class="prettyprint">id</code>s and <code class="prettyprint">access_tokens</code> for each prior authorization.  A detailed discussion of <code class="prettyprint">access_tokens</code> is available below.</p>

<p>Prescriber Preference: You may choose to register all prescribers using our Prescriber resource, or you may wish to allow prescribers to manage their preference.  If you allow self-management, you will need a &ldquo;checkbox&rdquo; that indicates that the user is using the CoverMyMeds integration.  When checked, you should have a Prescriber resource created at CoverMyMeds.  When unchecked, you should delete the Prescriber resource.</p>

<h3 id="mapping-the-workflow-to-the-api">Mapping the Workflow to the API</h3>

<p>There are two ways a PA is created:</p>

<ol>
<li>A Client System initiates a prior authorization with <code class="prettyprint">POST /requests/</code>.</li>
<li>A pharmacy sends data to CoverMyMeds using our <a href="https://www.covermymeds.com/main/pharmacy_claim_api">Pharmacy API</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once created, PAs are worked in the Client System through the Task List, which is retrieved through <code class="prettyprint">GET /requests/</code> or <code class="prettyprint">POST /requests/search/</code>.  This allows the Client System to have full control over which Client Users are allowed to access each PA request.  The response data contains a link (with an authentication token) to each request on the CMM website.</p>

<p>The actual PA request is displayed on a page served by CMM.  The link to each request page provides a seamless transition through single-sign on mediated by the <code class="prettyprint">access_token</code> contained in each link.</p>

<p>Upon each change in status to a prior authorization (e.g., the health plan approves the request), CMM will POST the request data to a <code class="prettyprint">callback_url</code> provided at PA creation, or if not provided, to the URL pre-configured for each Client System.</p>

<p>The Client System can also retrieve the latest status at any time for each PA through the <code class="prettyprint">GET /requests/</code> resource, or for multiple requests through the <code class="prettyprint">POST /requests/search/</code> resource.  These URLs may be &ldquo;polled&rdquo; at a reasonable interval (i.e., hourly) for systems that choose not to provide a callback_url.</p>

<p>Upon each new PA being created in an integrated pharmacy, CoverMyMeds will POST the same response data as in the <code class="prettyprint">POST /requests/</code> resource to your <code class="prettyprint">callback_url</code>.</p>

<p>Plans that participate in the ePA process with CoverMyMeds receive electronic PA requests, and provide electronic determinations (approved/denied), sometimes in real-time.  Plans that do not participate in the ePA process receive a PA request via fax, on their appropriate drug-specific form. Determinations for non-participating plans are provided directly to the prescriber (outside of the CMM workflow), however approval or denial may be tracked in CMM by the user.</p>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">GET /drugs/</code> resource allows you to implement a drug search so the user can pick a drug for their request.  When picked, you get our internal drug <code class="prettyprint">id</code>.  Partial and full drug names are supported-click here for a search for <a href="https://api.covermymeds.com/drugs/?v=1&amp;amp;api_id=1vd9o4427lyi0ccb2uem&amp;amp;q=Nex">&ldquo;Nex&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>You can use this resource to implement a &ldquo;type-ahead&rdquo; search.  We <a href="https://github.com/covermymeds/api-jquery-plugins/blob/master/src/jquery.drugsearch.js">publish a jquery plugin</a> that allows you to do this without any effort at all.</p>

<p>You must specify the <code class="prettyprint">request[prescription][drug_id]</code> when a new PA is created through the <code class="prettyprint">POST /requests/</code> resource.  Optionally, you may also include quantity and days supply, values which are usually required in the prior authorization submission to the plan.</p>

<p>You may submit CMM&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">drug_id</code> value returned from the <code class="prettyprint">GET /drugs/</code> resource, or you may submit an NDC value for this field.  Submitting an NDC is really just sugar-we will convert the NDC code you submitted to our internal identifier when we create the request.  Most plans will approve requests at the &ldquo;label name&rdquo; (drug, strength, form) or an even higher level, so you may pick a &ldquo;representative&rdquo; NDC code when submitting your request.</p>

<p>Submitting an NDC code is advantageous when you are initiating the request from the e-prescribing workflow where the user has already &ldquo;picked&rdquo; a drug in your system, and you know the NDC code. The <code class="prettyprint">/drugs/</code> resource is a good way to show a type-ahead search, such as you will need in the New PA form, so using CMM&rsquo;s internal drug_id can be convenient here.  </p>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">GET /forms/</code> resource allows you to implement a form search so the user may pick the appropriate prior authorization &ldquo;form&rdquo; for their request.  This resource works with both &ldquo;paper&rdquo; forms, and electronic prior authorization (ePA) requests.</p>

<p>You can use this resource to implement a &ldquo;type-ahead&rdquo; search.  We <a href="https://github.com/covermymeds/api-jquery-plugins/blob/master/src/jquery.formsearch.js">publish a jquery plugin</a> that allows you to do this without any effort at all.</p>

<p>Requests to this resource run our algorithm to determine the appropriate form based on the drug, state, and a text query. The text query is processed against our data for plan names, PBM names, form names, BIN, PCN, Group ID, and CMS Contract IDs.  The result is a &ldquo;scored&rdquo; list of the most appropriate forms for the request.  The top-result is usually the most appropriate for the user to pick.</p>

<p>When you create a new PA through the <code class="prettyprint">POST /requests/</code> resource, you may specify the form_id, as picked by the user.  Providing the form_id with the creation of the PA request is optional-if you choose not to include it, the user will be presented with our form search dialogue when they first visit the PA request through their Task List.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, it is best to include the form search as part of interactions that are conducted by administrative staff, such as the New PA Form, and to skip the search durring the e-prescribing workflow.</p>

<h1 id="/requests/">/requests/</h1>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">/requests/</code> resource is the workhorse of the API.  You will use it to create new prior authorizations, retrieve information about them, and get a list of them for your Task List.  Several additional features are provided for working with prior authorizations such as token management, using the CMM request page, theming, and the callback system.</p>

<p>Use this method to create a new prior authorizaton request. Because data is being &ldquo;put into&rdquo; the system, we require only the <code class="prettyprint">api_id</code> so that this request can safely be made from client-side code.  The http response will contain a link to the prior authorization and meta-data about the request.</p>

<p>You should consider whether to actually show the request to the user after it is created.  It is usually best to show the request page when a PA is created from the New Request Form, since that feature is likely to be used by an administrative staff person who wants to complete the PA in one sitting. However, when the PA is created in the e-prescribing workflow, it can be best to simply let the user know that the PA was created and let it be worked later by an administrative task person from the Task List.  The <a href="https://github.com/covermymeds/ehr-example">sample implementation</a> we provide uses a nice approach in that the confirmation message allows the prescriber to click to view the PA, but doesn&rsquo;t otherwise interupt the prescribing workflow.</p>

<p>Supporting a great user experience across thousands of health plan&rsquo;s distinct prior authorizaton forms, standards-based ePA transactions, and proprietary integrations presents many user interface challenges.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, it is best to let CoverMyMeds serve the actual prior authorization request page from our server.  The request page formats the PA for editing and provides a number of decision support and workflow tools.  We encourage you to &ldquo;theme&rdquo; the page for your Client System.  Details on how to do this are included in the <em>Theming</em> section.</p>

<p><img src="images/CoverMyMeds_pa_detail.png"></p>

<p>Clicking an item in your Task List should direct the user to the CMM request page.  The link to each request page provides a seamless transition through single-sign on mediated by the <code class="prettyprint">access_token</code> contained in each link.</p>

<p>You format a link like this:
<code class="prettyprint">http://www.covermymeds.com/request/:id?access_token_id={access_token}</code></p>

<p>You can <a href="https://navinet.covermymeds.com/request/view/VH9VW9?access_token_id=pfng1ujcmphwi3zkfugj">click here</a> to see an actual real link.</p>

<p>It is essential that your Task List contain the latest status information for each PA, and that you update it with new PAs that were created in the pharmacy.</p>

<p>You may do this by requesting <code class="prettyprint">GET /requests/</code> each time a user views a Task List, or you may implement an endpoint to which we may send data each time there is a change (e.g., the health plan approves the request).  CMM will format this request identically to the JSON response in the <code class="prettyprint">GET /requests/</code> resource.</p>

<p>If you implement an endpoint, you can specify a global <code class="prettyprint">callback_url</code> in your <a href="https://staging.api.covermymeds.com/consumers/signin">Developer Dashboard</a>, or you may submit a <code class="prettyprint">callback_url</code> for each request when creating them through <code class="prettyprint">POST /requests/</code>.  Setting this value on a per-PA basis allows you to distribute the callbacks to multiple on-premise systems or to different servers if you are load-balancing a multi-tenant architecture.</p>

<p>Your webservice should return an http status 200 or 201 when you receive the request and process it successfully.  You should return an http error code when the request cannot be processed.  CoverMyMeds&rsquo;s system will queue errors and retry them if the status codes are believed to be resolvable.  We will contact you if they are not successfully processed within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

<p>To enhance security, you may whitelist our ip address range, and we can send an http auth header using a username and password you supply.  Because your system should not &ldquo;give out&rdquo; information, these security measures are prudent to avoid the possibility of malfeasance, but not strictly required.</p>

<h2 id="theming">Theming</h2>

<p>You may specify the theming that is used on the CMM request page.  This theming is controlled by a global setting that is configured in your <a href="https://staging.api.covermymeds.com/consumers/signin">Developer Dashboard</a> or on a per-PA basis by submitting the <code class="prettyprint">theme</code> parameter in the link you construct to the CMM request page.</p>

<p>@TODO</p>

<h1 id="/prescribers/">/prescribers/</h1>

<p>A Prescriber resource allows us to share a PA that is initiated in the pharmacy with your user.</p>

<p>Most pharmacies use the CoverMyMeds system to initiate a PA after each claim rejection.  CoverMyMeds pushes these prior authorizations to the right place based on a credentialing process that maps prescriber NPIs to integrated EHRs or CoverMyMeds user accounts.</p>

<p>Doing this push involves mapping the Prescriber NPI field in the rejected claim to a flag that tells the CoverMyMeds system that claim rejections for the given Prescriber NPI should be available in your system.</p>

<p>Upon a PA being initiated by a pharmacy, CoverMyMeds will deliver the transaction by POSTing to your server.</p>

<p>For each pharmacy-initiated PA, CoverMyMeds POSTs data formatted identically to the response in the <code class="prettyprint">POST /requests</code> transaction. CoverMyMeds expects a 2xx (“ok”) http response; if we receive an error, we will queue the delivery and try again later.</p>

<p>Upon delivery, you should store the PA data, including the <code class="prettyprint">id</code>, <code class="prettyprint">access_token</code>, and <code class="prettyprint">prescriber_npi</code>.</p>

<p>Then, when you show the task list to the user, the pharmacy-initiated transactions are requested by <code class="prettyprint">id</code> and <code class="prettyprint">access_token</code> just as prescriber-initiated transactions are shown.</p>

<h2 id="managing-prescriber-credentials">Managing Prescriber Credentials</h2>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">/prescriber/</code> resource allows you to create, read, update and delete records in our system that map NPI numbers to delivery URLs.  To support on-premise or distributed/load-balanced systems, you may specify a different URL for each prescriber-credential.  If the delivery URL is unspecified, CoverMyMeds will POST transactions to a URL that may be pre-configured globally.</p>

<p>Not all actions are instantaneous-after creating or updating a prescriber credential, CoverMyMeds runs a security process to validate the credential request. Some manual steps may be taken, including contacting the user, such as in the common occurence that you are registering an NPI for a user that already exists in CoverMyMeds.  These manual processes are usually complete in less than 24 hours.</p>

<p>Your system is responsible for maintaining a map of credentialed NPIs to your users, and in turn, your users to PA data that we POST to you.</p>

<p>Upon a new prescriber-credential request, CoverMyMeds will contact the associated prescriber using our contact data and will confirm that they wish to have data delivered to your Client System.</p>

<h1 id="authentication">Authentication</h1>

<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>

<p>Visit the <a href="https://staging.api.covermymeds.com/consumers/signin">Developer Dashboard</a> page to register and manage your preferences.</p>

<p>When you register your Client System, you will be issued an <code class="prettyprint">api_id</code> and an <code class="prettyprint">api_secret</code>.</p>

<p>You may also specify a <code class="prettyprint">callback_url</code> which will be used to receive PA updates and new PAs.  The use of this url is optional.</p>

<h2 id="api-keys">API Keys</h2>

<p>Authentication for the API is performed with your <code class="prettyprint">api_id</code>.  If the resource could be destructive or reveal private information, the <code class="prettyprint">api_secret</code> or &ldquo;per-PA&rdquo; <code class="prettyprint">access_token</code>s are used in addition to the <code class="prettyprint">api_id</code>.</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">access_token</code>s are used to provide single-sign-on (SSO) for the Request page that is served by CMM.</p>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">api_secret</code> and <code class="prettyprint">access_token</code>s are effectively a type of password. Because the <code class="prettyprint">api_secret</code> is used across your integration, it should never be exposed to your user.  Exposing an <code class="prettyprint">access_token</code> is less problematic because it is used for only one request-which by definition your user already has seen. The section below includes more information on handling <code class="prettyprint">access_token</code>s.</p>

<p><aside class="warning">
While most resources will accept the <code class="prettyprint">api_key</code> and <code class="prettyprint">api_secret</code> in the http request body, it is best to pass them instead in the http authentication header, to minimize the chance that they could be recorded in someone&rsquo;s network or logging infrastructure. For clarity, we generally have ommitted this detail in our example code in this document.
</aside></p>

<p>You can and should change your <code class="prettyprint">api_secret</code> any time you suspect it may have been compromised.  Doing this will take immediate effect and can be done in the <a href="https://staging.api.covermymeds.com/consumers/signin">Developer Dashboard</a>.</p>

<h2 id="access-tokens">Access Tokens</h2>

<p>Most systems have the concept of a user. This user concept is frequently extended to include constructs such as user groups, organizations, and perhaps also practice locations, which may have composite properties of groups and organizations while adding another dimension.</p>

<p>Together, these concepts are used to provision access to database records, such as patients.  The relationship between database records and users may be relatively simple, such as a foreign key in the record that points to a user.  Or, it may be more complex, perhaps managing a many-to-many relationship that includes the user group and other hierarchies.  Additional complexity is involved when one considers how user-level changes should modify record access over time.  For example, if a new user is added to a record that was previously created, should this user now have access to the record?</p>

<p>You already know how to do all of this stuff-so we have designed the API to avoid compromising your carefully designed access controls.  We do this by skipping the user concept entirely&ndash;instead, we use <code class="prettyprint">access_token</code>s that grant access to the associated prior authorization to anyone in their possession.</p>

<p>An initial <code class="prettyprint">access_token</code> is created with each new PA through the  <code class="prettyprint">POST /requests/</code> resource.  The Client System may create new <code class="prettyprint">access_token</code>s and may destroy existing access tokens through the <code class="prettyprint">/requests/tokens/</code> resource.  Each PA may have zero or more access tokens at any one time.  If a PA does not have any access tokens, it innaccesible through the API and through the CoverMyMeds website-it is effectively deleted.  To undelete this PA, a new <code class="prettyprint">access_token</code> may be created.</p>

<h3 id="storing-access-tokens">Storing Access Tokens</h3>

<p>Access tokens should be stored by the Client System such that they can be used appropriately for any given user context.  To take a simple example, imagine that your system has a single user access control scheme.  The token management associated with this scheme would be easy-just keep a list of tokens with each user (perhaps all of the system-wide tokens in one table with a foreign key to the user).</p>

<p>Your system will probably be a bit more complicated than that. You&rsquo;ll probably want to provide access so that nursing and administative staff can see prior authorizations for their doctors, and everyone can see the work in their workgroup.  Remember to think about the three ways that prior authorizations may be created:</p>

<ol>
<li>By practice office staff, using the New PA Form</li>
<li>By the prescriber, in the e-prescribing workflow</li>
<li>By the pharmacy, associated with a prescriber NPI</li>
</ol>

<p>The first two usage scenarios involve a user directly.  The last usage scenario involves a prescriber that is associated with one or more users.  For the first scenario, access tokens should be stored so that they may be retrieved by the other users that share work with the creating user.  In the second and third scenario, access tokens should be stored so that they may be retrieved by all users that have access to the prescriber’s data.</p>

<h3 id="using-access-tokens">Using Access Tokens</h3>

<p>So that you may use client-side code to perform the integration, the <code class="prettyprint">/requests/</code> resource does not require the use of the api_secret.</p>

<p>This means that access tokens are effectively passwords.  Their security comes from being hard to guess (they are long random strings), and from not revealing them to users that shouldn’t be able to see their associated PA.</p>

<p>Each access token is unique for each request (i.e., they aren’t re-used)-this makes their use lower risk than typical password-based authentication systems-which could provide access to large volumes of protected health information if they are compromised.</p>

<p>You may choose to actively manage <code class="prettyprint">access_token</code>s. This is unneccessary unless the tokens are compromised, but you may wish to consider it if you are using tokens in a client-side application.  For example, you could regenerate tokens for a particular request if a user of the system shouldn’t have access to the PA request anymore.  While low risk, it would be possible that this user had previously recorded the <code class="prettyprint">access_token</code>.</p>

<p><aside class="notice">
A technique to consider in a client-side implementation is to make server-side requests with tokens, then to return the API response data (without the tokens) into a page where it can be used by a javascript client that is also loaded on the page. When clicked, the user is following a link to your server, and then redirected to the CMM page with the access token.

<p>It is important that your application handle errors responsibly. This generally means not failing silently, logging problems in your system, and showing good error messages to users.</p>

<p>To make this as easy as possible, we use real HTTP error codes, and return a JSON object for each error, shown in the code samples on the right.  One or more <code class="prettyprint">errors</code> may be returned.  Each <code class="prettyprint">message</code> should be displayed to the user, whereas <code class="prettyprint">debug</code> information is for your developers.</p>

<p>It is possible, particularly when you are first starting your integration, that a request made to our server will be so far from what is expected that our error message isn&rsquo;t useful, or that you receive frequent 500 (Internal Server Errors).  Please contact us and we will set up a live session with one of our developers to watch your requests and help sort these problems out quickly.</p>

<p><aside class="warning">
Be careful that your implementation doesn&rsquo;t create blocking requests that could impair the use of your application if an API request returns an error or failure.  For server-side requests, a timeout of 5000 milliseconds should prevent any real harm while making sure that requests aren&rsquo;t aborted. For client-side integrations, AJAX can be a useful technique so that your application can be loaded while API requests are made asynchronously.  Our <a href="https://github.com/covermymeds/api-jquery-plugins">javascript components</a> are already designed for this type of architecure.

<h1 id="getting-help">Getting Help</h1>

<p>CoverMyMeds provides complete technical assistance during the integration. Questions may be sent to <a href="mailto:developers@covermymeds.com">developers@covermymeds.com</a> until a regular contact is assigned.</p>

<p>When the integration is nearing completion, we&rsquo;ll assign an Account Manager to make sure you and your customers have direct access to our operations staff. Your Account Manager will provide:</p>

<ul>
<li>Training for your staff and customers</li>
<li>Exceptional help and marketing materials</li>
<li>Promotional support for your system</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="hipaa-and-security">HIPAA and Security</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>CoverMyMeds deploys a set of Policies and Procedures, together with Technical, Physical, and Administrative Safeguards to maintain compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, Security Rule, Transactions and Code Sets Rule, and their implementing regulations.</p>

<p>For our users who are Covered Entities (e.g., providers, plans, or PBMs), CoverMyMeds functions as a Business Associate. In some situations, we may also function as a Health Care Clearinghouse (a type of Covered Entity). For example, we meet his definition when health care providers use a system that integrates with us, such as using this API, or when we communicate with the plan or PBM using the ePA standard.</p>

<p>CoverMyMeds also publishes a Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. These materials may be found in our online <a href="https://www.covermymeds.com/main/privacy_center/">Privacy Center</a>.</p>

<p>Because our service is used as part of a health care provider’s Treatment and Operations functions, and because we do not sell data or otherwise invoke the requirements, we are not generally required to obtain Patient Authorization or Consent.</p>

<h2 id="business-associate-agreement">Business Associate Agreement</h2>

<p>CoverMyMeds uses a standard Business Associate Agreement with most providers, and may execute customized Business Associate Agreements with large health systems, pharmacies, and plans or PBMs (payers).</p>

<p>Integrating Systems will execute a Mutual Subcontract Business Associate Agreement with CoverMyMeds.  This document obligates both parties to terms of the Business Associate Agreement, and allows data to be exchanged between the parties.</p>

<p>You may begin your integration without the final execution of the Mutual Subcontract Business Associate Agreement, but this agreement should be in place before any actual PHI is exchanged.  In the interim, it is acceptable to use &ldquo;mock&rdquo; test data.</p>

<h2 id="controls-and-security-assessments">Controls and Security Assessments</h2>

<p>Security and privacy compliance is a cornerstone of our business.  We maintain an active internal program, and employ professional 3rd party auditors to evaluate our effectiveness.</p>

<p>Our programs have also been evaluated and assessed by many of the largest hospital systems, pharmacy chains, health plans and PBMs in the industry.  We welcome our Client System partners to conduct their own assessment, including security audits, onsite site reviews, and other measures.</p>
